#My Portfolio Page

##General Info

Here you will find information about my skills, projects, professional experience and my contact data. 
Idea, photos of designer toys from my collection and code by me.

##Site Construction

The site is originally written in **HTML5, Sass and jQuery**. It is written with RWD in mind in a grid structure.

##The Code

On the GitHub repository you will find **the source code** - from the very beginning when I started to build the site before any course, to its current version after one-month intensive training at Coder's Lab. 
To generate **the final CSS** you first need to compile Sass files into CSS and then run it through Gulp-Autoprefixer.

##See the Result!

You can access the final version of this site [here](http://www.warzecha.org/ola/Introduction/).


Enjoy!
