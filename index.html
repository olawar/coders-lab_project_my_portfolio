<h2>About Aleksandra Warzecha</h2>
<p>I have been working in public relations for tech companies for more than 7 years. I have managed PR campaigns, supported product launches and provided extensive communication strategy consulting. I saw many fascinating solutions and products during that time and I realised that in future I will need more direct contact with technology.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if it is possible to learn to code, when you are already an established professional in another domain? Well, I have and I finally made the first step - if you want to see how I'm doing, join my journey!</p>
